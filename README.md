## List of scripts
Here are my scripts:

1. ```removing_forbidden_characters_from_filenames.py```: this script allows to 
replace error-prone filenames with more computer friendly filenames. For instance,
   "some file (fijwef).csv" is replaced with "some_file_fijwef_.csv".
    
2. ```creating_sql_query_table_from_csv.py```: this script allows to create a sql query from csv file. 
   It uses pandas and numpy library. It recognizes correct datatype for each column.
